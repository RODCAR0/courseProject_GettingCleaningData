# Course Project: Getting and Cleaning Data
The aim of this project is to create a tidy data set from training and test data sets coming from an Acceloremeter (Samsung).
All features observed, are group by subject (30 volunteers) and activity (6 differerent activities) and then we apply the mean
for each feature.
